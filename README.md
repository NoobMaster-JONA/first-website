# first-website
This was a webpage i did as part of odin project assignment, using hmtl and css.
Starting on it was a difficult task, but once i started, began to feel easy.
I saw a video of someone doing the whole html part, and then adding css.
but i did part by part from top to bottom of the webpage, and it felt way better than trying to do the whole html of the page and then css.
Had a good time making this page, now starting with odin project javascript fundamentals
Wishing myself goodluck ;)
